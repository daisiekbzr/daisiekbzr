## Hi, I'm Daisie ðŸ‘¾

### I decided to switch careers and pursue my passion so here I am ðŸš€

- ðŸ”­ I'm studying <strong>Computer Science</strong> at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. I'm a Business Analyst with a BBA who believes in lifelong learning so - I flipped my life around.
- ðŸŒ± I started my programming journey with PostgreSQL and HTML/CSS in March '23. I am now learning <strong>C++</strong>.
- ðŸ¤– I'll be updating this repository with solutions to Project Euler problems, mini simple projects and more advanced projects and coursework as I progress through my studies.  
- ðŸŽ® Discovering what happens behind the scenes in game development has led me to dive into <strong>3D modelling</strong>. I started with recreating the Hyperbolic Time Chamber (from Dragonball Z) in <strong>Blender</strong> and a Matcha House. later on will try to train intelligent agents using <strong>Unity's ML-agents</strong> within the room. 
- ðŸ’ƒ My other passion is <strong>dancing</strong>. I dance Semba, Kizomba, Konpa, Bachata and Salsa.
