## Hi, I'm Daisie 👾

### I decided to switch careers and pursue my passion so here I am 🚀

- 🔭 I'm studying <strong>Computer Science</strong> at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.
- 🌱 I started my programming journey with PostgreSQL and HTML/CSS in March '23. I am now learning <strong>x86-64</strong>.
- 🤖 I'll be updating this repository with solutions to Project Euler problems, projects, but unfortunately the ones I'm working on the currently I can't publish as they're school assignments.  
- 🎮 Discovering what happens behind the scenes in game development has led me to dive into <strong>3D modelling</strong>. I started with recreating the Hyperbolic Time Chamber (from Dragonball Z) and a Matcha House in <strong>Blender</strong>.
- 💃 My other passion is <strong>dancing</strong>. I dance Semba, Kizomba, Konpa, Bachata and Salsa.
