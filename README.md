## Hi, I'm Daisie 👾

### I decided to switch careers and pursue my passion so here I am!

- 🔭 I will be studying <strong>Computer Science</strong> at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam starting in September '23!
- 🌱 I started my programming journey with PostgreSQL and HTML/CSS. I am now learning <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>C++</strong> in parallel.  
- 🎮 Discovering what happens behind the scenes in game development has led me to dive into <strong>3D modelling</strong>. I'm starting with an isometric lofi aesthetic bedroom in Blender!  
- 🤖 I'll be updating this repository with mini simple projects and more advanced projects and coursework as I progress through my studies.  
- 💃 My other passion is <strong>dancing</strong>. I dance Semba (from Angola - I know you were thinking sAmba which is from Brasil), Konpa and Bachata.
